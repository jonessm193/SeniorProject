Senior Project Progress
2/14/13-
	-4:00pm-
	Researched project options and different tutorials
	Looked into required setup for project
	-9:00pm-
2/17/13-
	-12:00pm-
	Set up virtual macine for testing on the development machine(so as to have the same hardware and easy access to the testbed)
	Built GCC-Cross-Compiler
	-3:00pm-
2/19/13-
	-12:00pm-
	Built simple libraries for the GCC-Cross-Compiler
	-2:00pm-
2/20/13-
	-2:30pm-
	(Scrap GCC-Cross-Compiler progress)
	Finish a Hello World printing kernel and run it on virtual machine.
	-4:00pm-
2/24/13-
	-4:00pm-
	Fix the many problems with the current version of the kernel by the tutorial from Bran.
	-6:00pm-
2/27/13-
	-8:00pm-
	Started working out finishing bugs on the "Hello, World!" kernel
	Installed boch-x module which was missing
	-10:00pm-
2/28/13
	-11:00am-
	Finally have all things working seemingly, except for one issue between the current version of Ubuntu and Boch virtual machine
	Fixed this problem by installing boch-sdl plugin.
	Successfully produced the "Hello, World!" screen printing kernel
	-3:00pm-
4/17/13
	-5:00pm-
	Got some time to kick this back up
	Implemented the GDT(Global Descriptor Table)
	Implemented the IDT(Interrupt Descriptor Table)
	Received a crash from dividing by zero, showing that interrupts are indeed observed by the kernel, but not handled
	-11:00pm-
4/21/13
	-8:00pm-
	Work on implementing Interrupts properly
	ISR IRQ work
	IRQs successfully handled
	Keyboard captured and translated to ASCII, then printed to screen
	-12:00am-
4/23/13
	-6:00pm-
	Begin research into memory management strategies and implementations
	Start implementation
	-8:00pm-
4/24/13
	-5:00pm-
	Successfully implemented Memory Management, paging
	Fairly granular as it does 4kb chunks and also is pretty basic
	-6:30pm-
4/26/13
	-3:00pm-
	Begin research and implementation of a file system
	Choosing a 4kb block size
	Well...just about accomplised nothing, aside for understanding everything about how a file system works
	I have absolutely nothing implemented for the file system as I'm still unsure how to go about it
	That being said I have a wonderful mental map of how it would be set up
	-9:00pm-
5/1/13
	-11:00am-
	More looking into where to start my file system progress, osdever.net is helpful
	-2:00pm-
5/4/13
	-1:30pm-
	Really cracking down to try and get my FDC(Floppy Disk Controller) implemented, so I can then create a file system
	Attempting to get all that done and also some simple commands to create and move files around
	FDC supposedly done, but upon successful compilation and my attempt to load the kernel, GRUB spits back an error
	Error is related to it being incorrectly formatted apparently
	Fixed my problem. My kernel now links the assembly in ELF 32bit format i386. This made it a bit larger
	This solved my issues though with my file size exceeding the binary version of the kernel formats allowance apparently
	FDC is looking to be implemented and working. I will make calls to it for testing later.
	-9:00pm-
5/6/13
	-2:00pm-
	Work on getting some form of terminal command in order to make calls to a file system
	Weird errors where the simple act of printing something on the screen is causing print code from my FDC to come out...
	Successfully have some pseudo commands working like a terminal. There are limits to this.
	No file system. Issues with the FDC.
	-8:00pm-
